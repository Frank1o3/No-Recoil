If you are going to edit the script run this commands:

1. python -m venv venv

if you are using visual studio code after the venv is made just re-open all the terminals

2. pip install requirements.txt

After you do your changes and the script works with no error do this:
3. pyinstaller --onefile Anti-Recoil.py
